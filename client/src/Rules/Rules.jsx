      <h1>Government Rules for Loan Approval Process</h1>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Priority Sector Lending</h2>
        <p>The RBI mandates that a certain portion of bank lending (typically 18%) should be directed towards agriculture and allied activities under the priority sector lending guidelines. This ensures that farmers have access to credit at affordable rates.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme</h2>
        <p>The KCC scheme enables farmers to have access to short-term credit without the need for multiple applications. Farmers are issued a credit card, which they can use to withdraw funds to meet their agricultural and allied needs.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Interest Rate Subvention Scheme</h2>
        <p>The Government of India often announces interest rate subvention schemes wherein farmers receive loans at subsidized interest rates. Under such schemes, the government bears a portion of the interest cost, making loans cheaper for farmers.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Crop Loans</h2>
        <p>Banks provide short-term loans to farmers for crop production purposes. These loans are typically available for a crop season and are to be repaid after harvest. Interest rates on crop loans are often subsidized under government schemes.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Collateral Requirements</h2>
        <p>For smaller agricultural loans, banks may waive the requirement of providing collateral or may accept agricultural land as collateral. This is especially prevalent in schemes like the KCC where loans are provided without collateral for smaller amounts.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Loan Repayment Terms</h2>
        <p>Flexible repayment options are often available for agricultural loans, taking into account the crop cycle and expected cash flows from agricultural activities. Loan repayment schedules are designed to align with the harvesting and selling of crops.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Insurance Requirements</h2>
        <p>Farmers may be required to take crop insurance under certain circumstances, especially when availing crop loans. This is to mitigate the risk of crop loss due to natural calamities.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Government Subsidies and Schemes</h2>
        <p>Various government schemes and subsidies are available to farmers for agricultural inputs, machinery, irrigation facilities, etc. Access to credit may be linked to participation in such schemes.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>Farmers need to provide necessary documentation such as land records, identification proofs, income statements, and details of crops cultivated while applying for loans.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="rule">
        <h2>Loan Application Process</h2>
        <p>Farmers can apply for loans through designated bank branches, cooperative banks, or through online portals provided by financial institutions. The application process involves submitting the required documents and fulfilling eligibility criteria.</p>
